## Order Statuses

Use custom order statuses to define your own work flow. There are only a few statuses which are fixed because they are used by plugins to set a status. You can recognize those statuses by the tiny lock after the name. You can change the display settings of those statuses but you can't remove them. The star symbol indicates that the status is the default status which is set once the order gets created.
