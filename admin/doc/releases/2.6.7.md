- New Features
	- Social Media Sharing Buttons. The links which can be shared for an image direct 
	  the user to a mini page which presents the image. With a click on this image 
	  the user gets redirected to the event. Facebook need to read the original image
	  so don't put any restrictions on the image folder if you want to use the sharing
	  options.
	- EXIF support for local images. Just sync your database to read the information 
	  from the files to the database. Once you did this, EXIF information will show up
	  for each image.
	- Thumbs contain now the original EXI information. This will help to have the 
	  necessary meta data available once those images appear somewhere else.

- Bug Fixes
	- fixed usage of wrong configuration set once the current menu item is not given
