- New Features
	- new highly customizable checkout and cart feature. 
	- plugin system for surcharges, shipping methods and payment methods
	- decreased Joomla 2.5 support. Still works, but looks kind of ugly sometimes.	
	- new sort options for event list. It's possible to sort by name now.
	- global configuration for events and event views. This allows you to access the gallery without a menu item and makes the configuration of multiple menu items much easier.
	- support for intro text and main text for the event text field. Just use the normal page break button to create the intro and the full version.
	- ability to filter, search and sort event list in back end

- Bug Fixes
	- fixed issue with sending a mail once somebody created a new comment
	- fixed a strange behavior of the captcha within some sessions. The captcha data is now generated once the single item page loads instead of during the captcha image loading.

- Migration Hints
	- if you used direct links to events of the type Pageable List you need to update those menu items. Otherwise the layout will be set by the global setting for the event layout.
