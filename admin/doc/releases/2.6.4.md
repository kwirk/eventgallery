## 2.6.4

- New Features
	- added option to display links to external sites instead of using the internal
	  add2cart button. As of now there is a global configuration option where you 
	  can define a pattern for the external link. Make sure you use the internal 
	  or the external cart button only. If you're fit with JavaScript you can 
	  target the new add2cart button and apply a different behavior. The link 
	  contains two attributes data-file and data-folder which might become useful.
	- Lightbox uses it's own name space now. This will reduce the conflicts with 
	  other lightbox includes.
	- List of events supports paging now
	- remove the a lot of configuration options for the events list (the new 
	  feature is the clean code ;-)
	- language lookup extended to 
	  language\overrides\language\xx-YY\xx-YY.com_eventgallery.ini so you can 
	  manage your localized files independent from the component. 

- Bug Fixes
	- fixed missing error messages on checkout page
	- updated markdown library to prevent some warning messages in the documentation 
	   view
	- fixes issue with flexible layouts. The width is calculated initially, then 
	  the scroll bars appear and the width decreases. The images will end up unaligned. 
	  Now I set the min-width of the container initially to a height so the 
	  scrollbars appear and the width calculation works.
