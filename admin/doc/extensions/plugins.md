## Search Plugin

The Search Plugin integrates with the Joomla Search component and finds events. It indexes the following fields:

- event description
- event text
- event tags

## Smart Search Plugin

The Smart Search Plugin provides an integration with the Joomla Smart Search component. It helps to fill the search index with information about your events. For that it uses the following fields: 

- event description
- event text
- event tags

Make sure the content plugin is enabled to update the index once you change events in the backend. If you sync your file system with the database make sure you rebuild the search index manually.
