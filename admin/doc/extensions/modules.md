## Event Module

The main purpose of this module is to show exactly one event somewhere on your page. You can define parameters like the event, the thumb size and the number of images you want to show. 

If you installed the module there is a new instace which you can find with the Joomla Module Manager. Make sure the module is configured correctly and shows up on at least one page. By default it is not assigned to any page or to any position in your template.

## Lastest Event Module

Shows a number of images from the latest event. You can define the meaning of "latest" using the settings for the event sorting. In addition the module has a setting for the event history position which allows you to configure for example three instances of this module type to display the three latest events.
