![Configuration options](img/backend/backend_overview_screen.jpg)


This page lists the components configuration options. The top toolbar provides three options: 

- Options

	Access the components options. See below for the available configuration option.

- Sync Database
	
	You can do the upload using FTP or the build in image uploader. Since this component uses the databases to store information about files it needs to be updated once you change something directly at file system level. You can add/remove files and folders. By hitting the sync button added folders and files get added to the database while removed files/folder get removed. Finally the database is in sync with the file system. If you try to upload using FTP put your images into a new folder below  _/images/eventgallery/_

- Clear Cache

	The component caches all calculated images. If you feel you have to clear this cache just hit this button. Keep in mind that refreshing the cache might be expensive.
