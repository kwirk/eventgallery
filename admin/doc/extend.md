%toc%

This section is intended to provide some help with customizations. Keep in mind that you should never touch files of the component directly. Use the overload techniques provided by Joomla to achieve your goal. For example put your changed CSS definitions into your templates CSS files. If you want to overload a view templates, put it into your templates html folder.
