# Plugins & Modules

In addition to the main component there are some plugins and modules available. Read more about them in the following section. After you installed a plugin or module they are by default disabled. Make sure you configure them for the first use and make them visible on your page.

# Plugins

Plugins offer a kind of hidden functionality. They are used to process data. Use the Joomla Plugin Manager to manage your plugins. Make sure they are enabled. Otherwise they'll not work.

# Modules

Modules can be used to display some additional information on pages. Your template offers a couple of module positions where you can plug modules in. Use the Joomla Module Manager to create new module instances and manage the existing ones. Make sure your modules are published and assigned to at least one page to let them appear.
