# Event Gallery Intro {#Intro}

It's time to introduce a new gallery component for Joomla. I guess you're already waiting for something like this since there is a real lack of such kind of components ;-)
Initially I build this component to show photos of different events to the audience. To where other components have folders this component calls them events. Because of this this component is called Event Gallery. 

If you want to support the development of this component you might want to have a look at this PayPal donation page or at Flattr.

Let's list all the features this gallery component provides:

- works with Joomla 3.0 and Joomla 2.5
- displays images from local folders and **Google Picasa**
- **cart & checkout** to allow the user to create a collection of images and request them from the photographer
- three different views for an image list
	- Image List

		This list type presents all images of an event as a simple long list. You can zoom into images using a lightbox.

	- Page able Image List

		While nearly identical to the Image List view this view provides a paging bar. Instead of opening each photo in a lightbox there is a dedicated page for every image. This page allows you to browser within the current event.

	- Ajax Image List

		If there is limited space the Ajax Image List is for you. It provides a split interface where you have a large image on one side and a pageable list of thumbs on the other side. 
- lightbox with integrated paging and support for *swipe gestures* on mobile

- comments - a user can comment a photo
- **deep links** - you can link from a menu directly to a specific event
- **tags** - you can assign tags to an event and use them to show events with specific tags in your event list only. 
- **responsive support** - the size of a image list changes, it'll recalculate the image layout to fit into the new page width
- Browser Support: partly IE7+IE8, IE9, Chrome & Firefox latest versions
